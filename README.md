Since I am a beginner, I wrote this application with "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/?couponCode=TRAVERSYMEDIA). 

Check Live Demo: https://sheltered-caverns-19723.herokuapp.com/

Then drink coffee ☕️ & have a nice day:)

Tech stack: 
[React]and [React Router]for frontend
[Express] and [Node] for the backend
[MongoDB] for the database
[Redux] for state management between React components
